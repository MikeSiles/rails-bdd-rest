# Readme
This application is a proof-of-concept of using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in Ruby on Rails through rspec. If you aren't familiar with BDD, I recommend checking out wikipedia's article on it.

The application makes a simple sales application that stores customers in a database, along with their people and locations. The endpoints limit what data is retrieved based on the user requesting the records, ostensibly the salesperson. Look at spec/requests/ for a starting point on reading the tests.

The goal of this is to make a thorough and complete introduction to using BDD to build a practical purpose. It demonstrates splitting logic into microservices instead of making it part of a layer--or worse yet, directly putting the logic in models and controllers, as well as handling 1-to-many, many-to-many and 1-to-1 relationships. Itâ€™s also a nice introduction to clean, tested authentication.

I owe much thanks to Austin Kabiru, and his tutorials on testing rails content in the form of a simple 'todo list' app. Much of the authentication remains the same, saving for small changes to accomodate updated libraries.

Also thanks to RailsGuides for clarifying the way that Active Record handles different associations

In addition, this StackOverflow question provides some clarity on how to do Join Tables from the command line.

And finally, a small thanks to the documentation on both Faker and Shoulda Matchers that I have used throughout the project.
